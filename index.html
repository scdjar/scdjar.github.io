	<p>Hello guys, this is <a href="https://www.twitter.com/sir_cheems" target="_blank">Sir_Cheems</a>, most of you must know me, I'm just a shibe(pro dogecoiner) on twimtter. Today I'm not gonna tip my followers or not giving away dogecoin, instead of giving this time, I need your help people.<br/><br/>
	Actually, one of my old friend's family is going through some financial problems, he is a nerd in studies and he just completed high school & <b>wants to pursue data science & work full time as a data scientist, but his parents can't afford that much</b>, they already have some loan & paying off monthly, so we both decided to do a crowd funding, & the best part is he will return all the money to all the donors. <b>The target was $4.5k(USD)</b>, but I helped him of $400(from my friends & relatives in-person) and I myself gave him $300 by selling all of my crypto including dogecoins & ethereums as help & <b>now needs more $3.8k</b>, the main problem is he don't want to reveal himself on the internet because he is a introvert and shy type of person & told me to help.<br/><br/>	
	Now the question is how he will pay that amount back ? So he decided to <b>create a website & run google ads on it, so he can generate income along with learning</b>, we hired a web dev for this he is working from last 1 month with us, he's also helping us by making the website for free, but it will cost to purchase domain+hosting for 5 years so it will be around $220. He(dev) will also charge $500 for 3 months of SEO & 8 months of advertising & content management so that website can be succeedd. There will be 8 months of advertising with $10/day ads so it will be around $2400 for advertising.<br/><br/>
	<b>Now the tagert is $3,800:</b> $500 for dev, $700 for course, $220 for domain+hosting, $700 for laptop & $2400 for advetisements for running a successful money-generating website.<br/><br/>
	He purchased a laptop with the money I handed him, but still needed $3.8k for remaining work, so if you guys can help/donate, please donate, click on the donate button given above & below. <b>I assure you that he will return all the money back to the donors as soon as he starts generating income from google adsense.</b><br/><br/>
	<b>We're using crypto donations so that each transaction will be transparent</b>, we have chosen some light-weight currencies because those have very low network-fee, anyone can easily donate without giving a lot of into fee, we've created a trust wallet account, and sir_cheems(I) will share each update on my twitter daily.<br/><br/>
	If you have donated, then please share the screenshot with us(on twitter account of sir_cheems direct message) with your crypto address(or with the address in which you want payback), so we can pay it back to you when we have, please remeber, <b>it can take upto 1 year to pay this amount back to each donor</b>, if you are not willing to donate, then please share it with your friends/family. <b>You are not just helping him just for a year, but for the lifetime</b>, because his website will be running & he will land a good job.<br/><br/>
	Thanks to everyone,<br/>
	Your Beloved Cheems
